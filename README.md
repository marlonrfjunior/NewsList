# News List

In this module I was able to improve my knowledge in SwiftUi and learn more about list, I created an application with a News List. Basically I'm showing the points that these news receive and their title, when you select some news it will open in another View with the URL of that news. The news I'm displaying comes from the website [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), I was able to return this news related data with the help of the [algolia API](http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?tags=front_page).
